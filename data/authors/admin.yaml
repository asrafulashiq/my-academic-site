bio: |
  I am a computer vision and deep learning engineer at NVIDIA. I completed my PhD from the ECSE department of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Troy, NY, supervised by Prof. Richard Radke. Broadly, I am interested in computer vision and deep learning. I develop neural network models for unsupervised, semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, and few-shot learning. I have also worked on action detection and object tracking.

  Previously, I spent three wonderful summers at Microsoft Research, IBM Research and Kitware. I completed my undergrad in Electrical Engineering from BUET, Bangladesh.
