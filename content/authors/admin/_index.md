Hello! 
I am a fourth year PhD student at the ECSE department of [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)](https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/), Troy, NY, supervised by [Prof. Richard Radke](https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~rjradke/index.htm). Broadly, I am interested in computer vision and deep learning. I develop neural network models for unsupervised, semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, and few-shot learning. I have also worked on action detection and object tracking. 
Previously, I spent time at [IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/) and [Kitware](https://www.kitware.com/). I completed my undergrad in Electrical Engineering from [BUET](https://eee.buet.ac.bd/), Bangladesh.
